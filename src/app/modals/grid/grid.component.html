        GRID provides a system for the unique identification of "Releases" of
        music over electronic networks, so that they can be managed efficiently.
        A Release is defined precisely in the Standard but can be understood as a
        collection of recordings or other media that are grouped together for commerce.

        As an Independent Artist you may not have a GRID. Mark as N/A if
        there is no GRID.
